abstract: "Abstract. The interplay between climate-forced sea level change, erosional
  and depositional processes, and flexural isostasy in deep time on passive margin
  deltas remains poorly understood. We performed a series of conceptual simulations
  to investigate flexural isostatic responses to high-frequency fluctuations in water
  and sediment load associated with climatically driven sea level changes. We model
  a large drainage basin that discharges to a continental margin and produces a large
  deltaic depocenter, then prescribe synthetic and climatic-driven sea level curves
  of different frequencies to assess flexural response. Results show that flexural
  isostatic responses are bidirectional over 100–1000 kyr timescales and are in sync
  with the magnitude, frequency, and direction of sea level fluctuations and that
  isostatic adjustments play an important role in driving along-strike and cross-shelf
  river mouth migration and sediment accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that climate-forced
  sea level changes produce a feedback mechanism that results in self-sustaining creation
  of accommodation into which sediment is deposited and plays a major role in delta
  morphology and stratigraphic architecture.\n                    "
description: Two-thirds of the world's most populated cities are situated close to
  deltas. We use computer simulations to understand how deltas sink or rise in response
  to climate-driven sea level changes that operate from thousands to millions of years.
  Our research shows that because of the interaction between the outer layers of the
  Earth, sediment transport, and sea level changes deltas develop a self-regulated
  mechanism that modifies the space they need to gain or lose land.

    caption: Our simulations produce catchment areas, river lengths, and volumes of
      deposited sediment that are consistent with the ranges observed in continental-scale
      deltas such as the Mississippi and Amazon rivers. (a) Example showing the outputs
      from the numerical simulation showing the elevation and bathymetry (top) and
      cumulative flexure (bottom). Model dimensions are 4500 km x 2000 km, with a
      vertical exaggeration of 100x. (b) Scatter plot of river length (top) and 405
      shelf width (bottom) versus catchment area from river systems. Data is from
      Somme et al. (2009), Nyberg et al. (2018), Blum et al. (2013, 2017) and simulations
      presented in this study. Pal= Paleocene, Oli=Oligocene, PM= Paleo-Mississippi.

      flexural compensation (right).

    caption: "\nOutput of numerical simulations with imposed synthetic sea-level curves
      with different frequencies (f) showing elevation, bathymetry and discharge of
      the river mouth at 8 Myr. Note the difference in lateral extent, elevation due
      to flexural rebound, and river mouth morphology between the flexural (top) and
      non-flexural (bottom) cases. (b) Change of river mouth location though time
      for simulations where synthetic and empirical sea-level curves were imposed.
      Mean river mouth transit distances in the non-flexurally compensated simulations
      are shown in lighter shades, whereas the flexurally compensated cases are shown
      in darker shades. (c) Bar plot showing the frequency of the number of times
      where the de-trended river-mouth trajectory crosses an arbitrary point in the
      shelf an indicator of how often the river mouth is close to the shelf break.

  caption: The animation shows the surface and stratigraphic evolution of our simulated
    continental-scale deltas. We let each simulation initialize and run for 2 Myr
    without any sea-level fluctuations so that the delta can reach dynamic equilibrium
    without any disturbances in base level, then impose climate-forced sea-level changes.

  summary: Planview of model setup (top) and cross-section in the middle of the modeling
    domain. The initial configuration of the modeling domain resembles the topography
    of a natural source-to-sink system with 3400 m elevation in the headwaters, a
    length of 4500 km, a downstream-decreasing fluvial channel slope, and successive
    inflections in gradient associated with the coastal-plain to continental shelf
    and shelf to slope transitions. To ensure that our simulated drainage basin produces
    a point-source for sediment input to the marine domain we imposed a longitudinal
    topographic low in the middle of the model.
