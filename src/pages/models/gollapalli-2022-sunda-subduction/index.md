abstract: The negative buoyancy of the slab primarily controls the subducting plate
  and trench motions, and tectonic stresses around the convergent margins. Lateral
  variations in negative buoyancy associated with varying slab depth along strike
  must affect plate and margin motions, and, most importantly, have an impact on the
  stress acting across the margin, thereby setting the context for plate coupling,
  tectonics and present-day seismicity. Here, we investigated these interactions in
  3-D subduction numerical models, focusing on along-trench variations in the subduction
  depth and the resulting perturbations to the force balance. While we focus on the
  steps in the slab depth, we additionally test the role of subducting plate, i.e.,
  cohesion and viscosity, and upper plate properties, i.e., thickness, viscosity,
  and cohesion. The results show that the magnitude of convergence velocity only depends
  on the integrated slab mass and rheology of the subducting plate when the upper
  plate is thin. Instead, the trench retreat/advance is sensitive to the heterogeneity
  in the slab depth, and a complex pattern arises atop the slab step, with a characteristic
  length of ~500 km from the slab depth perturbation. The remaining parameters of
  the subducting and upper plate mainly affect the magnitude of the trench velocities
  with minor influence on the pattern. The highest deformation/stress in the upper
  plate is observed around the slab step due to the rigidity of the plate, causing
  mutual perturbation between the deep and shallow slab portions, and the lateral
  flow around the step. These results are compared with the observations along the
  Sunda margin, where similar slab depth variations are found. The upper plate deformation
  in the model shows remarkable compatibility with the observed distributions of compression
  and extension of the Andaman- Sumatra-Java segments. Our study indicates that trench-parallel
  forces, arising from the natural variations of slab depth, exert a first-order control
  on the plate coupling and deformation along convergent margins and should not be
  neglected.
description: The negative buoyancy of the slab drives subducting plate and trench
  motions, influencing tectonic stresses at convergent margins. Variations in slab
  depth along the trench affect plate coupling and seismicity. We investigated these
  effects using 3-D subduction models, focusing on slab depth variations and their
  impact on force balance. Results show convergence velocity is primarily controlled
  by slab mass and subducting plate rheology, while trench movement is sensitive to
  slab depth heterogeneity. The highest stress occurs around slab steps, aligning
  with deformation patterns observed along the Sunda margin. This study highlights
  the crucial role of trench-parallel forces in plate dynamics.

  summary: The model setup consists of the subducting plate with attached slab and
    upper plate inserted in the 660 km upper mantle lying over 340 km lower mantle.
    The model extends 4000 km in each x, y, and 1000 km in the z-axis with a numerical
    resolution of 512√ó512√ó128, respectively. This resolution results in an element
    size of 7.8 km in all three directions. Each element is populated with 20 Lagrangian
    particles to store material properties. All boundaries in the model are under
    free slip conditions. All models include a 100 km thick subducting plate and slab.
    The rheology in the top 30 km (crust) is viscoplastic, and the rest (70 km lithospheric
    mantle) is viscous. Oceanic lithosphere has a density contrast of 50 $kg/m^3$
    with respect to the underlying sublithospheric mantle. The entire slab has a uniform
    initial dip angle of 45¬∞. The upper plate consists of crust 30 km thick, and its
    lithospheric mantle thickness is varied between 20 km, 40 km, and 60 km. The trailing
    end of the subducting plate is free and upper plate end is fixed. The density
    contrast between the upper plate and mantle is set to zero. This avoids lithostatic
    pressure gradients, and the stress distribution in the upper plate is only influenced
    by the dynamics driven by lateral slab buoyancy variations.  Therefore, the stress
    distribution in the upper plate can be used as a proxy for tectonic coupling at
    the interface.
