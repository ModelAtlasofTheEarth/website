abstract: "Seafloor spreading at slow rates can be accommodated on large\u2010offset\
  \ oceanic detachment faults (ODFs), that exhume lower crustal and mantle rocks in\
  \ footwall domes termed oceanic core complexes (OCCs). Footwall rocks experience\
  \ large rotation during exhumation, yet important aspects of the kinematics\u2014\
  particularly the relative roles of solid\u2010block rotation and flexure\u2014are\
  \ not clearly understood. Using a high\u2010resolution numerical model, we explore\
  \ the exhumation kinematics in the footwall beneath an emergent ODF/OCC. A key feature\
  \ of the models is that footwall motion is dominated by solid\u2010block rotation,\
  \ accommodated by the nonplanar, concave\u2010down fault interface. A consequence\
  \ is that curvature measured along the ODF is representative of a neutral stress\
  \ configuration, rather than a \u201Cbent\u201D one. Instead, it is in the subsequent\
  \ process of \u201Capparent unbending\u201D that significant flexural stresses are\
  \ developed in the model footwall. The brittle strain associated with apparent unbending\
  \ is produced dominantly in extension, beneath the OCC, consistent with earthquake\
  \ clustering observed in the Trans\u2010Atlantic Geotraverse at the Mid\u2010Atlantic\
  \ Ridge."
