abstract: We investigate how the mechanical properties of intra-oceanic arcs affect
  the collision style and associated stress-strain evolution with buoyancy-driven
  models of subduction that accurately reproduce the dynamic interaction of the lithosphere
  and mantle. We performed a series of simulations only varying the effective arc
  thickness as it controls the buoyancy of intra-oceanic arcs. Our simulations spontaneously
  evolve into two contrasting styles of collision that are controlled by a 3% density
  contrast between the arc and the continental plate. In simulations with less buoyant
  arcs (15–31 km; effective thickness), we observe arc-transference to the overriding
  plate and slab-anchoring and folding at the 660 km transition zone that result in
  fluctuations in the slab dip, strain-stress regime, surface kinematics, and viscous
  dissipation. After slab-folding occurs, the gravitational potential energy is dissipated
  in the form of lithospheric flow causing lithospheric extension in the overriding
  plate. Conversely, simulations with more buoyant arcs (32–35 km; effective thickness)
  do not lead to arc-transference and result in slab break-off, which causes an asymptotic
  trend in surface kinematics, viscous dissipation and strain-stress regime, and lithospheric
  extension in the overriding plate. The results of our numerical modeling highlight
  the importance of slab-anchoring and folding in the 660 km transition zone on increasing
  the mechanical coupling of the subduction system.

    caption: This research shows that a buoyancy contrast of 3% between the colliding
      buoyant remnant arc and the continental plate determines the style of collision.
      A buoyancy contrast less than 3% results in arc transference to the continental
      overriding plate and slab-anchoring . In contrast, a buoyancy contrast more
      than 3% results in slab break-off and failed arc transference.

  summary: 'The model develops in a cartesian domain 3600 km in length (in the horizontal
    direction) and 800 km in depth. It includes an oceanic subducting plate (dark
    yellow), an overriding plate composed by a continental (cyan) and cratonic domain
    (dark blue), and a ribbon of thicker crust representing a remnant = intra-oceanic
    arc attached to the oceanic plate (red). The upper mantle and the upper-lower
    mantle boundary are included to capture deep-mantle slab interactions. Orange,
    yellow, and dark green dots show locations where subducting plate convergence
    velocity, the trench-retreat velocity and the overriding plate (OP) retreat velocity
    were measured. The (b–e) profiles show a schematic lithospheric cross-section
    of the domains considered in our model set-up. (b) Lithospheric profile of the
    oceanic plate which is composed by a 7 km thick oceanic crust and the cold-brittle
    oceanic lithospheric mantle. (c) Lithospheric profile of the cratonic continental
    lithosphere which is composed by a 40 km thick continental crust and a thermally
    mature and thicker continental lithospheric mantle. (d) Lithospheric profile of
    the continental plate which is composed by a 20 km thick continental crust and
    a thermally mature continental lithospheric mantle. (e) lithospheric profile of
    the intra-oceanic arc composed by an upper arc-crust of basaltic composition,
    and a middle-lower arc crust averaged between gabbro (same as basalt) and tonalite.
    Therefore, a thicker middle-lower intra-oceanic arc crust makes the arc more buoyant.
    Note that the effective arc thickness is defined as the overall thickness of all
    crustal levels: upper crust, middle-lower crust. Because the effective thickness
    of the upper intra-oceanic arc crust tends to be similar to the normal oceanic
    crust, the middle-lower arc crust can be considered as a free parameter as implemented
    in Leng & Gurnis [2015].'
