abstract: Away from tectonically active regions, the continental crust has an average
  thickness of 40 ± 1 km. Yet, it shows a remarkable variability from 25 to 65 km,
  comparable to that of the most tectonically active regions. Here, we consider the
  problem of the formation and preservation of anomalous deep crustal roots in stable
  intracontinental regions. Using two-dimensional thermomechanical experiments, we
  show that the interplay between partial melting, the formation of garnet-pyroxene-bearing
  rocks, and their strain rate–dependent retrogression result in the preservation
  of thick and strong crustal roots. We argue that it is the partitioning into narrow
  regions of strain, retrogression, and weakening coupled into a positive feedback
  loop that explains why strong high-grade crustal roots remain largely immune to
  gravitational stresses and are able to persist over hundreds of millions of years.

  summary: "Our 2D thermo-mechanical experiments consider a 360 km wide orogenic plateau
    with a 70 km thick crust (i.e. the thickness of the Tibetan plateau, Nabelek et
    al., 2009) above 40 km of mantle (Fig.2). A layer of air-like material with low-viscosity
    and low-density is imposed on top of the crust to accommodate the development
    of surface topography. The plateau is experiencing extensional deformation as
    the crust returns to a normal thermo-mechanical state. Extensional velocity boundary
    conditions are imposed on both vertical walls of the model. We have tested slow
    (0.18 cm.y-1) and fast (1.8 cm.y-1) velocities, delivering a strain rate averaged
    over the length of the model of 3e-16 s-1 and 3e-15 s-1 respectively. Horizontal
    boundaries of the model are free slips. The thermal properties of the material
    combined with constant basal heat flow and constant top temperature deliver an
    initial steady-state geotherm leading to a Moho temperature of ca. 900 °C (Fig.
    2). We select from the literature plausible visco-plastic parameters (Suppl Data)
    so the mechanical behavior of the modeled lithosphere depends on temperature,
    strain rate, deviatoric stress and accumulated strain. Details of modeling procedures,
    rheological and thermal parameters as well as the input python script are available
    in GSA Data Repository*. \r\nIn order to explore the interplay between partial
    melting, the formation of stronger garnet-pyroxene bearing rocks and their retrogression
    into weaker amphibolite facies rocks we parameterize three first-order metamorphic
    phase transitions. The first phase change simulates partial melting and its feedback
    on density, viscosity and temperature (Rey et al., 2009, Suppl Data).  A second
    phase change with feedback on density and viscosity occurs at T = 1050 K to simulate
    prograde amphibolite to garnet-pyroxene rock reaction (Philpotts and Ague, 2009).
    Finally, a third phase change with feedback on density and viscosity accounts
    for the retrogression of garnet-pyroxene bearing rocks back into amphibolite facies
    rocks. This third phase change occurs at T = 1050 K as well and for a strain rate
    ≥ 10-14 s-1. Our model implicitly assume that water is available. Therefore, retrogression
    is contingent upon strain rate, which simulates the metastability of dry high-grade
    rocks during exhumation. This strain rate threshold is in the range of expected
    strain rates measured in orogenic shear zones (Sassier et al., 2009; Boutonnet
    et al., 2013; Faregeng and Biggs, 2018). Rock solidus depends on their fertility
    and availability of fluid. Hence, we have tested different solidus for the continental
    crust and the garnet-pyroxene-bearing rocks (Suppl Data) in the range commonly
    accepted for these rock types. For the continental crust we have tested a solidus
    representative of fertile metapelites with a melting temperature at room pressure
    of 923 K (Fig. 3a, b; White et al., 2001), and a solidus representative of less
    fertile rocks with a melting temperature at room pressure of 993 K (Fig. 3c; Rey
    and Müller, 2010). For the dry garnet-pyroxene-bearing crust, we use a melting
    temperature at room pressure of 1063 K representative of refractory granulites
    (Cenki-Tok et al., 2016). We use Underworld, a well-tested open source finite
    element code, to solve the equations of conservation of momentum, mass and energy
    for an incompressible fluid on a Cartesian Eulerian mesh (Moresi et al., 2007;
    Beucher et al., 2019)."
