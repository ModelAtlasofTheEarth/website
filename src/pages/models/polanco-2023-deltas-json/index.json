  "abstract": "The interplay between climate-forced sea-level change, sediment erosion and deposition, and flexural adjustments in deep time on passive margin deltas remains poorly understood. We performed a series of conceptual simulations to investigate flexural isostatic responses to high-frequency fluctuations in water and sediment load associated with climatically driven sea-level changes. We model a large drainage basin that discharges to a continental margin to generate a deltaic depocenter, then prescribe synthetic and climatic-driven sea-level curves of different frequencies to assess flexural response. Results show that flexural isostatic adjustments are bidirectional over 100-1000 kyr timescales and are in sync with the magnitude, frequency, and direction of sea-level fluctuations, and that isostatic adjustments play an important role in driving along-strike and cross-shelf river-mouth migration and sediment accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that climate-forced sea-level changes produce a feedback mechanism that results in self-sustaining creation of accommodation into which sediment is deposited and plays a major role in delta morphology and stratigraphic architecture.\n",

    "summary": "We use BADLANDS (Salles and Hardiman, 2016; Salles et al., 2018) to explore how the interplay between climate-forced sea-level change, erosion/deposition and flexural adjustments in deep time can impact the morphology, architecture and stratigraphic evolution of continental scale deltaic depocenters. BADLANDS links landscape and basin dynamics through simulation of erosion, landscape evolution, and sedimentation. The flexural isostatic response of changes in water and sediment load is calculated using a two-way coupling between BADLANDS and gFlex. The initial configuration of the modeling domain resembles the topography of a natural source-to-sink system with 3400 m elevation in the headwaters, a length of 4500 km, a downstream-decreasing fluvial channel slope, and successive inflections in gradient associated with the coastal-plain to continental shelf and shelf to slope transitions. S1). To ensure that our simulated drainage basin produces a point-source for sediment input to the marine domain we imposed a longitudinal topographic low in the middle of the model. The three-dimensional spatial mesh size and temporal resolution were chosen to adequately reproduce the first-order geomorphological and architectural evolution of deltaic systems. Details about boundary conditions and input parameters used in modeling simulations can be found in Table 1 of Polanco, et al., 2022, and the data repository."
