abstract: 'This study investigates the dynamics and constitutive behaviour of the
  oceanic lithosphere as it bends and yields during subduction. Two main observational
  constraints are considered: the maximum bending moment that can be supported by
  the lithosphere, and the inferred neutral plane depth in bending. We particularly
  focus on regions of old lithosphere where the ‘apparent’ neutral plane depth is
  about 30 km. We use subduction modelling approaches to investigate these flexural
  characteristics. We reassess bending moment estimates from a range of previous studies,
  and show a significant convergence towards what we call the ‘intermediate’ range
  of lithosphere strength: weaker than some classical models predict, but stronger
  than recent inferences at seamounts. We consider the non-uniqueness that arises
  due to the trade-offs in strength as well background (tectonic) stress state. We
  outline this problem with several end-member models, which differ in regard to relative
  strength in the brittle and ductile regimes. We evaluate the consistency of these
  models in terms of a range of constraints, primarily the seismic expression of the
  outer rise. We show that a 30 km neutral plane depth implies that net slab pull
  is not greater than about 2 TN m−1. In contrast, models with low brittle strength
  imply that regions with a 30 km neutral plane depth are under moderate net axial
  compression. Under these conditions, reverse faulting is predicted beneath the neutral
  plane at depths &amp;gt;30 km. We show that moderate variations in background stress
  have a large impact on the predicted anelastic dissipation. We suggest brittle reverse
  faulting is a marginal phenomenon which may be inhibited by moderate changes in
  background stress.'
description: Tectonic plates are recycled into the mantle through subduction, where
  they bend and deform in various ways, such as brittle failure. This process creates
  deep sea trenches and results in characteristic earthquake patterns and gravity
  anomalies. In this study, we used a numerical model to investigate plate bending
  dynamics, complementing simpler approaches like flexural yield strength envelopes.
  We focused on the competition between bending stress and sources of net in-plane
  stress, such as slab pull, which influences the plate's neutral plane depth. It
  is difficult to reconcile the 'apparent' neutral plane depth with a net slab pull
  force greater than about 2 TN/m. Deviatoric compression in subducting plates more
  easily explains reverse earthquakes at depths of 20-50 km in the bending plate.

    caption: Downdip component of strain rate tensor and resolved stress difference
      from the numerical model, focusing on features within the plate/slab. The resolved
      stress difference is defined as ($\sigma_{s} - \sigma_{z}$), where $\hat{s}$,
      and $\hat{z}$ are unit vectors in the downdip and slab normal directions. The
      fields show, for example, shortening/extension in the downdip direction. Stress
      profiles at four locations are shown. The blue line ($x_0$) is the first zero
      crossing based on analysis of the flexural component of the topography. The
      black line is the location of maximum bending moment.

    caption: 'The main panel shows the variation in terms that arise in a 2D "vertically
      integrated" form of the force balance (or stress equilibrium) equations. Assuming
      a traction-free surface, the force balance states that across a horizontal section
      of the lithosphere, the following terms must sum to zero: 1) integrated basal
      shear traction, 2) the difference in the vertically-integrated deviatoric stress
      and 3), the difference in the vertically-integrated vertical normal stress (often
      called the GPE). In the figure, the overbar symbols represent vertical integration
      across the lithosphere. Specifically, integration from a reference height, (taken
      here as the mean ridge height) down to a reference depth (taken here as 150
      km beneath the reference height). In the main panel, the black line shows the
      horizontal variation in the vertically integrated deviatoric stress difference
      ($\tau_{xx} - \tau_{yy}$).  Positive values indicate a state of deviatoric tension.
      The dashed blue line shows the horizontal variation in the vertically integrated
      vertical normal stress ($\sigma_{yy}$)  (or the GPE). Strictly speaking, this
      quantity is only equal to the GPE when the vertical normal stress is lithostatic,
      but the term is retained in this study due to convention. The upper panel shows
      the subducting plate topography at 2 different scales.'

      The texture is generated with a line integral convolution of the velocity field.
      Contours show evolution of the slab during the 10 Myr simulation. Velocity arrows
      show convergence rates at 5 Myr into the simulation. Inset panels show details
      of the adaptive mesh refinement during the simulation.

  caption: 'Animation shows the model domain at 2x vertical exaggeration. The scalar
    field is the effective strain rate, i.e. $\dot\epsilon_{II} =  \sqrt{J2} = \sqrt{0.5(\dot\epsilon_{i,j}:
    \epsilon_{i,j})}$. Upper panel shows the evolution of the model topography (a
    true free surface). The topographic profile reveals the long-wavelength isostatic
    thermal subsidence, as well as the flexural topography associated with the subduction
    zone. The model exhibits a very short-wavelength instability in the free surface
    of the over-riding plate, which begins approximately 3 Ma after the start of the
    simulation.'

  summary: The subduction model comprises a rectangular domain with a depth of 2900
    km, and an aspect ratio of 4. The initial conditions comprise an adiabatic mantle
    with a potential temperature of 1350 C and two plates, whose age and thermal structure
    follows the cooling 1d cooling profile for a half-space (infinite in the depth
    direction). One of these plates is attached to a slab that extends to 660 km depth,
    and has an age of 100 Myr at the trench. The upper plate is modelled with a younger
    thermal age, 25 Myr at the trench. Imposing an initial slab that reaches the transition
    zone was found to be a more stable initial configuration in terms of instabilities
    of the free surface. 7 levels of mesh refinement were used, with the largest (Q2)
    elements having an edge length of 45 km, and the smallest elements have an edge
    length of ∼ 700 m. The interface is modelled through an entrained weak layer approach.
    A thin layer (here 2 km thick) represented by a separate composition is imposed
    on the top of the subducting plate, as well as between the subducting slab and
    upper plate. This composition has a low coefficient of friction, providing a shear
    stress that varies between between about 10 - 20 MPa throughout the plate interface
    domain. See the included model input file (.prm) for further details.

  notes: Model setup is provided by an ASPECT input file and a WorldBuilder file (https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder).
    Minor modifications to the ASPECT source code were implemented and are discussed

  notes: "Computations were done using the ASPECT code version 2.4.0. ASPECT output
    data from 2 simulations are included with this model. The reference model is the
    same model setup/data described in Sandiford and Craig, (2023). An alternative
    model is included in which the over-riding plate is welded to the left sidewall
    at the start of the simulation (whereas the initial temperature field in the reference
    model has a ridge). Note that both simulations develop a short-wavelength instability
    in the free surface of the over-riding plate, which begins approximately 3 Ma
    after the start of the simulation. The top level directories contains typical
    ASPECT output files, including log.txt and restart files. The primary output data
    consists of:\r\n\r\n-  plain text files representing model topography (e.g. topography.00000)\r
    \n- a range of \"field\" data, in .vtu format in the `./solution` sub-directory
    (e.g. solution-00000.0000.vtu). At each output step, there are 48 vtu files written.
    These can be opened with Paraview using the solution.pvd file in the top level.
    Quantities generally have SI units. Velocities are output as meters/year. \r\n\
    -  particle information stored as .vtu files (16 per timestep). Particles were
    used to track the 2-km-thick weak entrained layer that facilitates the plate interface
    decoupling zone."
