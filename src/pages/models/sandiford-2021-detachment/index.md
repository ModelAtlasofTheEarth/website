abstract: Seafloor spreading at slow rates can be accommodated on large‐offset oceanic
  detachment faults (ODFs), that exhume lower crustal and mantle rocks in footwall
  domes termed oceanic core complexes (OCCs). Footwall rocks experience large rotation
  during exhumation, yet important aspects of the kinematics—particularly the relative
  roles of solid‐block rotation and flexure—are not clearly understood. Using a high‐resolution
  numerical model, we explore the exhumation kinematics in the footwall beneath an
  emergent ODF/OCC. A key feature of the models is that footwall motion is dominated
  by solid‐block rotation, accommodated by the nonplanar, concave‐down fault interface.
  A consequence is that curvature measured along the ODF is representative of a neutral
  stress configuration, rather than a “bent” one. Instead, it is in the subsequent
  process of “apparent unbending” that significant flexural stresses are developed
  in the model footwall. The brittle strain associated with apparent unbending is
  produced dominantly in extension, beneath the OCC, consistent with earthquake clustering
  observed in the Trans‐Atlantic Geotraverse at the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge.
description: This model was developed in order to study the rotation of footwall rocks
  beneath oceanic detachment faults (ODFs). It showed that solid-block rotation dominates
  beneath a concave-down fault, while significant flexural stresses form later during
  "apparent unbending," causing both compression and extension-related brittle strain
  within oceanic core complexes (OCCs).

  summary: The domain is $400 \; \mathrm{km}$ wide and $100 \; \mathrm{km}$ deep,
    and includes five levels of mesh refinement, as shown in the figure. The model
    is initialised with a symmetric temperature structure, defined by a transient
    1-D cooling profile, with an age of $0.5 \; \mathrm{Myr}$ in the center of the
    domain. The thermal profile ages outwardly in proportion to the applied spreading
    rate of $2 \; \mathrm{cm\,{yr}^{-1}}$ (full rate), which is representative for
    slow spreading ridges. Uniform inflow at the bottom boundary balances the outward
    flux of material at the side boundaries. The model has a true free surface, and
    a diffusion process is applied to the surface topography in order to counteract
    strong mesh deformation. A simplification here is that the effect of the water
    column is ignored, i.e. the detachment system is modeled as sub-aerial. There
    is no compositional differentiation in the model (i.e. no crust/mantle) and all
    parts of the domain are subject to the same constitutive model. The constitutive
    model incorporates viscous (dislocation creep), elastic and plastic (pseudo-brittle)
    deformation mechanisms, hereafter referred to as visco-elastic plastic (VEP) rheology,
    following the approach of Moresi et al. (2003). The advection-diffusion equation
    included an anomalously- high diffusivity $(3 \times {10}^{-6} \; \mathrm{m^2
    \, s^{-1}})$ which is intended to model the near axis cooling effect of hydrothermal
    circulation (cf. Lavier and Buck, 2002). As implemented here, the higher diffusivity
    applies throughout the domain, rather than being localized at the ridge (as in
    Lavier and Buck, 2002). The parameters chosen here result in $\sim 10 \; \mathrm{km}$
    lithosphere at the ridge axis, which is in the range identified for ODF development.
    Due to the difference in diffusivity values in the initial conditions $({10}^{-6}
    \; \mathrm{m^2 \, s^{-1}})$, and temperature evolution equation $(3 \times {10}^{-6})$,
    the thermal structure is not in steady state and some cooling of the off-axis
    lithosphere occurs.

  notes: 'Data directory contains output data for 2 simulations stored in the following
    directories: ref_model_hires, alt_model_hires. Top level contains typical ASPECT
    output files, including log.txt and restart files. Topography and mesh variables
    were output at 100 Kyr intervals. Model end time is 5 Myr. Main output data consists
    of of plain text files representing model topography (e.g. topography.00000),
    vtu files (in the ./solution sub-directory) representing model output fields (e.g.
    solution-00000.0000.vtu). At each output step, there are 16 vtu files written.
    These can be opened with Paraview using the solution.pvd file in the top level.'
