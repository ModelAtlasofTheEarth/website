abstract: "Numerical models of groundwater flow play a critical role for water management
  scenarios under climate extremes. Large-scale models play a key role in determining
  long range flow pathways from continental interiors to the oceans, yet struggle
  to simulate the local flow patterns offered by small-scale models. We have developed
  a highly scalable numerical framework to model continental groundwater flow which
  capture the intricate flow pathways between deep aquifers and the near-surface.
  The coupled thermal-hydraulic basin structure is inferred from hydraulic head measurements,
  recharge estimates from geochemical proxies, and borehole temperature data using
  a Bayesian framework. We use it to model the deep groundwater flow beneath the Sydney–Gunnedah–Bowen
  Basin, part of Australia’s largest aquifer system. Coastal aquifers have flow rates
  of up to 0.3 m/day, and a corresponding groundwater residence time of just 2,000 years.
  In contrast, our model predicts slow flow rates of 0.005 m/day for inland aquifers,
  resulting in a groundwater residence time of <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\\
  sim $$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"\
  >\n                  <mml:mo>∼</mml:mo>\n                </mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula> 400,000
  years. Perturbing the model to account for a drop in borehole water levels since
  2000, we find that lengthened inland flow pathways depart significantly from pre-2000
  streamlines as groundwater is drawn further from recharge zones in a drying climate.
  Our results illustrate that progressively increasing water extraction from inland
  aquifers may permanently alter long-range flow pathways. Our open-source modelling
  approach can be extended to any basin and may help inform policies on the sustainable
  management of groundwater."
