abstract: Long‚Äêlived high to ultra‚Äêhigh temperature (HT‚ÄêUHT) granulitic terranes formed
  throughout Earth's history. Yet, the detailed processes involved in their formation
  remain unresolved and notably the sequence of appearance and duration of migmatisation
  and granulites conditions in the orogenic cycle. These processes can be evaluated
  by analytical and numerical models. First, solving the steady‚Äêstate heat equation
  allows underlining the interdependency of the parameters controlling the crustal
  geotherm at thermal equilibrium. Second, performing two‚Äêdimensional thermo‚Äêmechanical
  experiments of an orogenic cycle, from shortening to gravitational collapse, allows
  to consider non‚Äêsteady‚Äêstate geotherms and understand how deformation velocity may
  affect the relative timing of migmatite and granulite formation. These numerical
  experiments with elevated radiogenic heat production and slow shortening rates allow
  the formation of large volumes of prograde migmatites and granulites going through
  the sillimanite field as observed in many HT‚ÄêUHT terranes. Finally, the interplay
  between these parameters can explain the difference in predicted pressure‚Äêtemperature‚Äêtime
  paths that can be compared with the natural rock archive.

  summary: "The numerical models are performed with Underworld, a well-tested open-source
    finite element code, to solve the equations of conservation of momentum, mass,
    and energy for an incompressible fluid on a Cartesian Eulerian mesh (Moresi et
    al., 2007; Beucher et al., 2019). The 2D thermo-mechanical experiments involve
    a geological model of dimensions 480 km x 160 km discretized over a computational
    grid made of 240 x 80 elements. The initial setup consists of a 35 km or 40 km
    thick crust with 20 km of air-like material above, and mantle below (Fig. 2A-B).
    Each model runs through three stages: \r\n\r\ni) a shortening phase during which
    the crust thickens to ~ 60 km with either a slow total velocity of 0.24 cm/yr
    during 70 My or a fast total velocity of 2.4 cm/yr during ~ 7 My (delivering a
    strain rate averaged over the length of the model of $1.6 \\times 10^{-16} s^{-1}$
    and $1.6 \\times 10^{-15} s^{-1}$ respectively); ii) a rapid increase in BHF (from
    $0.020 W/m^2$ to $0.030 W/m^2$) over 2.5 My while the velocities imposed on the
    vertical boundaries are set to zero (vx = vy = 0 cm/yr) mimicking the thermal
    impact of a mantle delamination phase; iii) a relaxation phase in which the crust
    returns to normal thickness under slow extensional boundary conditions (total
    velocity of 0.10 cm/yr) associated with a decrease in BHF from $0.030 W/m^2$ to
    $0.020 W/m^2$ in ~ 70 My. Details of modeling procedures, rheological and thermal
    parameters, as well as the input Python script, are available as supplementary
    data.\r\n\r\nThese experiments focus on two end-member crustal structures with
    average values of total RHP at ~ $1 \\mu W/m^3$ and ~ $2 \\mu W/m^3$ (Fig. 2).
    A value of ~ $1 \\mu W/m^3$ is in line with RHP calculations predicted from the
    present-day composition of the bulk continental crust determined by Taylor and
    McLennan (1995). Models RHP1_unif mimic a Phanerozoic orogenic cycle involving
    a continental crust with a uniform RHP ($1.0483 \\mu W/m^3$) yielding an initial
    Moho temperature of 650¬∞C at 40 km depth (Fig. 1A). However, Mareschal and Jaupart
    (2013), Artemieva et al. (2017), and Gard et al. (2019) showed that the crustal
    RHP may have been higher than ~ $1 \\mu W/m^3$ during the Proterozoic, having
    varied between ~ $0.8 \\mu W/m^3$ and ~ $4 \\mu W/m^3$ between 0.5 Ga and 2.5
    Ga with an average RHP close to ~ $2 \\mu W/m^3$. In addition, recent studies
    reveal that, in tectonically stable regions, the upper crust‚Äôs RHP may be higher
    than in the lower crust (Goes et al., 2020; Alessio et al., 2020). The conditions
    for model RHP2_diff include a total average RHP of ~ $2.0922 \\mu W/m^3$ with
    high RHP in the upper crust (~ $5 \\mu W/m^3$) that decreases exponentially with
    a length scale factor $h_c$ of 20 km yielding an initial Moho temperature at 35
    km depth of 650¬∞C (Fig. 1D). Models RHP2_diff aim at approaching thermal conditions
    of a differentiated crust prevailing during the Proterozoic."
