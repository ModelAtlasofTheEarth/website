Dan is an Earth Scientist specialising in geodynamics: geo (as in the rocky Earth); dynamics (as in *why* stuff moves). His research endeavours to link computational models of the  earth with the insights from earthquake data (the rocks deforming  beneath our feet). He is currently a Research Fellow at the University  of Sydney, working on the Model Atlas of the Earth (M@TE). This  AuScope-funded project curates and distributes numerical simulations to  increase re-usability and educational potential. He has previously  worked at the University of Tasmania, the GFZ in Potsdam, and Monash  University.
