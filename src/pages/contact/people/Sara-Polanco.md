Sara Polanco uses numerical modeling and field information to understand how and why landscapes change in time and space. Decoding the dynamic evolution of landscapes provides fundamental information to sustainably manage water resources and to implement technologies that naturally reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere. 

Her career has followed an international path from Colombia to the USA and Australia. She is passionate about the role of geosciences in helping achieve the UN sustainability development goals.
