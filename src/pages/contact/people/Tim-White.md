Tim is a data science software engineer at the Sydney Informatics Hub. He has a background in physics and astronomy, completing his bachelor's degree (Hons I with medal) and PhD, both at the University of Sydney. He subsequently worked at the University of Göttingen in Germany, Aarhus University in Denmark, and ANU, before return to Sydney in 2019 as a University of Sydney Fellow. In his previous research, he measured fundamental properties of stars, and developed data pipelines and novel data processing techniques for NASA’s Kepler and TESS missions. With extensive experience analysing large and complex astrophysical data sets, Tim is eager to apply and expand his skills to broader range of research questions.
