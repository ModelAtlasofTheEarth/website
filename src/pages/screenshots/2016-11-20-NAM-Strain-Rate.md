![NAM Strain Rate](../../img/NAM_strain_rate.png)

North America deforming network (with interior rigid blocks) coloured by dilatation strain rate (red is extension, blue is compression). Also shown are principal components of strain accumulated since deformation began at a few select locations (outward-facing red arrows for extension and inward-facing blue arrows for compression).
