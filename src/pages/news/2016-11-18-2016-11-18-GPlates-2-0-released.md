What's new in version 2.0:-

* Projects and recent sessions:
  * Now saves and restores all layer information:
      * Including layer order, visibility and all settings within each layer (such as colour styles and colour palette filenames).
  * Open projects using File menu, drag'n'drop, double-clicking or command-line.
  * Project name displayed in window title.
  * Copy a project to another computer. For example:
      * Zip up a folder containing project file and associated data files (including colour palette files).
      * Unzip to another computer and open project file.
  * Option to locate missing data files (when loading project or recent session):
      * Useful when data files moved since project or session was saved.
  * Option to resolve ambiguous data filenames (when loading relocated project):
      * Useful when data files exist in both original and relocated locations.
  * GPlates 2.0 can open projects and recent sessions saved by all prior versions of GPlates:
      * However information saved by earlier versions is limited.
  * GPlates 1.5 can open projects and recent sessions saved by GPlates 2.0:
      * However restored information is limited (to what GPlates 1.5 can understand).
* Deformation:
  * Topological networks:
      * Boundary is similar to a topological closed plate boundary, but also has:
          * A deforming interior region (due to individual deforming points).
          * Optional interior rigid blocks.
      * Build New Network Topology tool now publicly available (without requiring command-line switch to enable).
      * Export topological network boundaries in general Resolved Topologies export.
      * Query and visualise velocities and strain rates at arbitrary points in networks.
      * Optionally display total (accumulated) strain at arbitrary points:
          * Displays principal components and orientation.
          * Outward-facing red arrows for extension.
          * Inward-facing blue arrows for compression.
  * Reconstructing regular features using topologies:
      * Use both topological rigid plates and deforming networks to reconstruct regular features.
      * Incrementally reconstructs by plate ID in topological rigid plates.
      * Incrementally deforms in topological deforming networks.
      * Begin incremental reconstruction at a feature's time of appearance, digitisation time or present day.
      * Use specific topological layers or default to all loaded topologies.
      * Option to detect lifetime of each point in a geometry:
          * Oceanic points appear (mid-ocean ridges) and disappear (subduct).
          * Based on convergence velocity and distance to plate boundary during a plate/network transition.
  * Scalar coverages:
      * A new geometry type in a new layer type.
      * Each point in a multipoint/polyline/polygon has a scalar value associated with it.
      * For example, visualise mid-ocean ridge spreading rates and asymmetry calculated externally using pyGPlates.
  * Crustal thinning:
      * A specific type of scalar coverage containing crustal thickness values.
      * GPlates recognises this coverage type internally:
          * Uses deformation strain rates to evolve crustal thickness over time.
      * An input dialog generates initial crustal thickness points:
          * Uniform distribution of points within a topological rigid plate or deforming network boundary (with optional random offset).
          * Specify initial constant/flat crustal thickness at a past geological time.
      * Choose from a selection of built-in colour palettes to visualise crustal thickness variations over time.
      * Export crustal thickness values to GMT(xy) or GPML format.
      * Also added a separate export for deformation (strain rates).
* New Hellinger tool:
  * GPlates has a new workflow to determine best-fitting poles by the method of Hellinger:
      * Import and export data files compatible with the FORTRAN programs of Chang and co-workers.
      * Edit and create magnetic pick data points, via the canvas or tabularly via the Hellinger dialog.
      * Adjust segmentation of magnetic picks.
      * Enable/disable magnetic picks from inclusion in the fitting algorithms.
      * Specify pole and angle estimates via the canvas or via the Hellinger dialog.
      * Perform fitting using a python implementation the FORTRAN programs.
      * Visualise resulting fit and uncertainty on the canvas.
      * Export fit and uncertainty data to text file.
* Net rotation export:
  * GPlates now calculates and exports net rotation of the lithosphere (based on the method of Torsvik et al., 2010) using global coverages of dynamic plate polygons.
  * Net rotations are exported via the standard "Exportâ€¦" tool, and by selecting the "Net rotation" export type.
  * Any dynamic plate-polygon data sets currently active in GPlates will be used as the basis for net rotation calculations.
* Official public release of volume visualisation:
  * No longer require command-line switch to enable importing of 3D scalar fields.
  * Latest improvements:
      * Reads georeferencing and spatial reference system (SRS) from first depth layer during import.
      * Frees disk space after import (removes cached depth layer rasters).
      * Fixed flickering cross-sections.
      * Fixed SVG export of isosurfaces (on Mac OS X).
* Improved OGR spatial reference system (SRS) support:
  * GPlates now has more complete support for OGR-supported files (e.g. ESRI shape file, OGR-GMT and others) which provide spatial reference system / projection information.
  * Any SRSs supported by the PROJ4 library should now be accepted by GPlates.
  * When saving to a file which had a non-WGS84 SRS associated with it, GPlates will prompt the user to export in either the original SRS, or in WGS84.
  * All other forms of file export in GPlates continue to use WGS84.
* Donut polygons:
  * Contain interior holes.
  * Supported in file input/output, raster reconstruction, filled polygons, 3D scalar fields, etc.
* Colour palette improvements:
  * Available in raster, 3D scalar field and scalar coverage layers.
  * Remap the range using mean and standard deviation of the layer data (raster, 3D scalar field or scalar coverage).
  * Added a variety of built-in colour palettes based on ColorBrewer sequential and diverging colour scales.
* Raster reconstruction improvements:
  * Improved stability and speed when connecting raster layer to polygons layer.
  * Removed raster seams/cracks between adjacent polygons.
* Toggle visibility of all layers:
  * Using the new visibility icons in the Layers dialog.
* Combine multiple rotation layers into one layer.
* Added velocity time interval options to velocity layers.
* New half-stage reconstruction (version 3) for mid-ocean ridges:
  * Changes to spreading asymmetry, after digitisation, no longer incorrectly reposition ridge.
* Improved handling of import / export directories:
  * GPlates now stores the last used directory for Project files.
  * In addition, there is more fine-grained support for both Feature Collection and Project folder preferences.
  * These can be adjust through the Preferences (Ctrl+,) dialog.
* Added named ages with timescale information and uncertainty tracking:
  * Supported for various feature types in GPlates Geological Information Model (GPGIM).
  * Find-as-you-type named ages with timescale colouring.
