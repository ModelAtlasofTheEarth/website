![GPlates 0.9.7.1 released](./img/screenie-composition-0-9-7-1.png)

Changes since 0.9.5:

* GPlates can now utilise a __full screen mode__, which is available by pressing __F11__. This mode is ideal for presenting data and animations using GPlates. It makes the user interface more minimalistic, granting a greater amount of screen space to the main view. This is especially useful on low-resolution devices such as projectors.
* A new __Measure Distance Tool__ has been implemented, allowing precise measurement of the distance between any two chosen points. It also interacts with the digitisation and feature-selecting tools, to enable easy inspection of the distances along polyline geometries and polyline segments.
* Exporting the Total Reconstruction Poles table to CSV can now be done with a choice of delimiters, and more closely adheres to the CSV specifications.
* The previous 0.9.6 release involved the __integration of the plate polygon closure workflow__ into the main stable branch of GPlates. With 0.9.7.1, additional work has gone into improving the user experience and making the topology algorithms more intelligent, and enables the __export of geometry sub-segments__ involved in topologies.
