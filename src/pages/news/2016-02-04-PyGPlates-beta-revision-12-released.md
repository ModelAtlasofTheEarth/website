![PyGPlates beta revision 12 released](../../img/pygplates_doc_contents.png)

Welcome to the first __beta__ release of the GPlates Python library known as pyGPlates.

PyGPlates enables access to GPlates functionality via the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. This may be of particular use to researchers requiring more flexibility than is provided by the GPlates user interface.

The following pyGPlates functionality is available:-

* Load and save feature data (GPML, Shapefile, etc).
* Create/modify/query feature data.
* Traverse/modify/query plate rotation hierarchy.
* Partition into plates and assign plate properties.
* Reconstruct geometries, flowlines, motion paths.
* Resolve topological plates and query their boundary sections (ridges/subductions).
* Calculate velocities.
* Distance between geometries (region-of-interest queries).
* Geometry queries (length, point-in-polygon, area, centroid, tessellate, interpolate, join, partition).

Download this release from the [Download](/download) page. It supports Python 2.7. And compiles and runs on Windows 7/8/8.1, Linux and MacOS X.

The pyGPlates documentation and tutorials are available on the [User Documentation](/docs) page.

The pyGPlates documentation includes:

* an introduction to pyGPlates,
* an installation guide,
* a 'Getting Started' tutorial,
* documented sample code,
* foundations of pyGPlates, and
* a detailed reference of pyGPlates functions and classes.

The pyGPlates tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks that analyse and visualise real-world data using pyGPlates. These tutorials complement the sample code in the pyGPlates documentation by providing a more research-oriented focus.
