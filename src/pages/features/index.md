title: Features of GPlates
intro: GPlates is a plate-tectonics program. Manipulate reconstructions of geological and paleo-geographic features through geological time. Interactively visualize vector, raster and volume data. PyGPlates is the GPlates Python library. Get fine-grained access to GPlates functionality in your Python scripts.

capabilities:
    - to handle and visualise data in a variety of geometries and formats, including raster data
    - to link plate kinematics to geodynamic models
    - to serve as an interactive client in a grid-computing network
    - to facilitate the production of high-quality paleo-geographic maps
